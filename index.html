    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to
          350°F (177°C).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make the crust: Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into
          crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter
          until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the food
          processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and
          slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need
          to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack
          the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven
          and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will
          wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to
          slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
        </p>
      </li>

          Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle
          attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on
          medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and
          creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and
          lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the
          eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended.
          After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To
          help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools,
          avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.
        </p>
      </li>

          Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set.
          When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if
          you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door
          slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it
          cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool
          cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the
          cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
        </p>

          Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
          springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut
          into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip
          into warm water between each slice.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover
          cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
